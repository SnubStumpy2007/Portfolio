                        <p class="paragraph">My name is Nicholas Stypinski.  I am a student in The Ohio State University Full Stack 
                            Developer Bootcamp.  My goal is to become a junior full stack developer.

                            I have played around with coding off and on since high school.  I started to take it seriously in the winter of 2022 when I bought
                            my first Udemy courses on HTML and CSS.  From there it was finding out more of what I wanted to do with coding.
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            I enjoy the prospect of building something with my hands and troubleshooting.  From when I built my first computer, I enjoy the challenge of 
                            building something and making it work.  And I love the problem solving aspect of development.  Thank you for visiting my portfolio.
