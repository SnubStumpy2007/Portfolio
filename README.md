## About Me
My name is Nicholas Stypinski. I am a student in The Ohio State University Full Stack Developer Bootcamp. My goal is to become a junior full stack developer.

I have played around with coding off and on since high school. I started to take it seriously in the winter of 2022 when I bought my first Udemy courses on HTML and CSS. From there it was finding out more of what I wanted to do with coding.

I enjoy the prospect of building something with my hands and troubleshooting. From when I built my first computer, I enjoy the challenge of building something and making it work. And I love the problem solving aspect of development.
